# isshoni reference

Moved here unchanged from the README. The dashboard is specified in [specs/tui.md](specs/tui.md).

Read-only CLI over `~/.claude/projects` transcripts (Python 3.11+, stdlib only).
```
bin/isshoni sessions [--since 7d]     # sessions grouped by repository and task, with totals
bin/isshoni session <id-prefix>       # totals by model/agent, warnings, dispatch timeline
bin/isshoni agents [--since 7d]       # per agent type: tokens, p50/p90, repeats, WARN
bin/isshoni agents --repo isshoni --task ci-workflow   # tokens by agent and model for one task
```
`sessions` and `agents` accept `--repo NAME` and `--task NAME` (exact match).
Global options: `--json` (one JSON document on stdout), `--projects-dir`,
`--agents-dir` (agent definitions used for the model WARN), `--repeat-threshold`
(Jaccard, default 0.5). `--since` takes `Nd`, `Nh`, `Nw` or an ISO date.
Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 usage error (unknown or ambiguous session id, bad option).
Flags in the timeline: `repeat`, `review-loop`, `rechecked`, `WARN`, plus the
status when not `completed` (`running`, `no-run`, `orphan`).

Grouping: a task is a git worktree a session worked in. A session belongs to one
repository and at most one task: the last worktree it entered (from the
`worktree-state` lines of its main transcript, ignoring `agent-<hex>` subagent
worktrees), else its first `cwd`; the repository is the path before
`/.claude/worktrees/`. A session that switched worktrees is counted whole under the
last one; its `worktrees` field lists every task it entered. In `--json` each session
gains `repo`, `repo_path`, `task`, `worktrees`, and `sessions --json` gains `repos`
(repository and task totals with the same keys as a session). Known limits: a session
started in a subdirectory of a repository, outside any worktree, shows that
subdirectory as its repository; review loops are detected inside one session, so a
task's count is the sum over its sessions.

Plugin agents: a plugin's agent is dispatched as `<plugin>:<name>` (`factory:coder`)
and counts as `<name>` for review loops, re-checks and repeats, and for its colour and
position in the dashboard. Its full name is shown, and it keeps its own row in `agents`
and its own `by_agent` key, apart from a bare `coder`. Its model is not checked by
default, because a transcript does not record where a plugin's definitions were loaded
from; pass `--agents-dir <plugin>/agents` to check it against `<name>.md` there (the option
replaces the default directories, so bare agents are checked against the same files).

For a resumed agent (`SendMessage`), duration covers dispatch to first return while
tokens include the resumed work. `running` means no completion (hand-back or
task-notification) was found in the transcript.
